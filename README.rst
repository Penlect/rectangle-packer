**Primary use:** Given a set of rectangles with fixed orientations,
find a bounding box of minimum area that contains them all with no
overlap.

This project is inspired by Matt Perdeck's blog post `Fast Optimizing
Rectangle Packing Algorithm for Building CSS Sprites`_.

* The latest documentation is available on `Read the Docs`_.
* The source code is available on `GitHub`_.


Installation
============

Install latest version from `PyPI`_:

.. code:: sh

    $ python3 -m pip install rectangle-packer

Or `clone the repository`_ and install with:

.. code:: sh

    $ python3 setup.py install


Basic usage
===========

.. code:: python

    # Import the module
    >>> import rpack

    # Create a bunch of rectangles (width, height)
    >>> sizes = [(58, 206), (231, 176), (35, 113), (46, 109)]

    # Pack
    >>> positions = rpack.pack(sizes)

    # The result will be a list of (x, y) positions:
    >>> positions
    [(0, 0), (58, 0), (289, 0), (289, 113)]

The output positions are the lower left corner coordinates of each
rectangle in the input.

These positions will yield a packing with no overlaps and enclosing
area as small as possible (best effort).

.. note::

    * You must use **positive integers** as rectangle width and height.

    * The module name is **rpack** which is an abbreviation of the package
      name at PyPI (rectangle-packer).

    * The computational time required by ``rpack.pack()`` increases by
      the number *and* size of input rectangles.  If this becomes a problem,
      you might need to implement your own `divide-and-conquer algorithm`_.

**Example B:**

**Example C:** Sometimes the input rectangles simply cannot be packed in
a good way. Here is an example of low packing density:

**Example D:** The image below is contributed by Paul Brodersen, and
illustrates a solution to a problem discussed at stackoverflow_.
